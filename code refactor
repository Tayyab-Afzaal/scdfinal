a. Create a project folder on your PC and name it with your roll number:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the location where you want to create the project folder.
Execute the following commands:
bash
Copy code
mkdir <your_roll_number>
cd <your_roll_number>
b. Initialize a Git repository for your project. Then, configure the commit author specifically for this repository:

Execute the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git init
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
c. Create the main class "E-learning" and perform all the required functions there:

Create a file named Elearning.java (or any preferred language extension) and implement the main class with required functions.
d. Create separate feature branches for each function identified from the above case study, ensuring that each branch is named according to the scenario to reflect the feature it implements:

Execute the following commands for each feature:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b authentication-feature
git checkout -b course-management-feature
git checkout -b student-enrollment-feature
git checkout -b discussion-forums-feature
git checkout -b live-sessions-feature
git checkout -b assessment-grading-feature
e. Merge each feature branch into GitHub:

For each branch, merge changes to the main branch (or your designated default branch) and push to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge authentication-feature
git push origin main
f. Handle any conflicts that may arise during the merging process:

Resolve conflicts manually or use a merge tool. Follow on-screen instructions to complete the merge.
g. Create local and remote repositories. Set the name of the local default branch to "main":

If not done already, initialize a local repository using git init.
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Set the default branch on GitHub to "main".
h. Establish a connection between the remote repository and local repository by setting the remote on the local repository:

Execute the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
i. Push the class. Push Your Changes to GitHub. Ensure that your local changes are pushed to your GitHub repository:

Execute the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
j. Create a separate feature branch (on their local repository) for each function available in the scenario. Then push the feature branch to the remote repository:

Execute the following commands for each feature branch:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b authentication-feature
git push origin authentication-feature
k. Push your changes to GitHub using the git push command:

For each feature branch, execute the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git push origin <feature-branch-name>
l. Pull the updated remote repository so that the local repository can also be updated accordingly:

Before making changes, pull the latest changes from the main branch:
bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
